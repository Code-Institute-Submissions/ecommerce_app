This is a ecommerce website that offers a varied category of products from televisions, consoles, pc's and all the equipment that you need to get started setting up your office or living room entertainment system.

## UX
We designed the website to be very intuitive and easy to use, helping people find what they are looking for in a easy and quick manner. 
Users will be able to browse through all the items in the website, sort them by various categories and have information being quickly displayed for them, such as price, ratings, reviews, everything they need in order to decide which product is the best fit for them.
